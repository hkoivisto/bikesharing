A high percentage of rides are from subscribers, indicating a high liklihood for repeat customers:

## Summary

#### Conclusions
Citibike has a strong footing as a subscription-based commuting tool for men across New York City, as seen by the above visualizations. 

#### Future Considerations
Future visualizations to consider are a look at the correlation of weather with Citibike use, and a look at the correlation of users to bike station locations.
